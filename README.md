# HundredProblemsInJava

## This code repository is meant for the new book - "100 Problems in Java", I am ariting on Java Language basics
## It will cover, not a great deal, but only the basics. I hope the code samples will help readers understand how Java language works.
### I have already added 51 code snippets that have only covered primitive data types, different types of variables, and different types
of Array methods.
### It has also talked about using external library like apache commons lang3, which is a great library that one should learn.
