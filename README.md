# HundredProblemsInJava

## This code repository is meant for the new book - "100 Problems in Java", which I have written on Java Language basics; although it covers a little bit more, such as Polymorphism, Interface, Abstraction, Exception handling and a soft introduction to Data Structure.
## It will cover, not a great deal, but only the basics. I hope the code samples will help readers understand how Java language works.
### I have added 100 code snippets that have covered these all.
### It has also talked about using external library like apache commons lang3, which is a great library that one might learn and use in their projects.
